# Seizure-Waves Analysis

To run the analysis with example data, follow these steps:
- Change your current working directory in matlab to the toolbox folder:
`cd seizure-waves`
- Edit the script <b>main_seizure_waves.m</b> to change parameters if necessary. 
In particular, specify the path to the <a href="http://chronux.org/">Chronux toolbox</a> in variable CHRONUX_PATH. 
You can also choose to run the analysis for an interval of 10s of real data recorded
during a seizure or simulated data generated by the model provided in this toolbox.
- Run the script <b>main_seizure_waves.m</b> or execute section by section
